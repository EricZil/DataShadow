## üëÄ What's this all about?

DataShadow is your personal digital bodyguard in the wild west of the internet! We handle billions of leaked records scattered across the digital landscape and make it ridiculously easy to check if your data has been compromised.

**Because let's face it:** In today's world, asking if your data has been leaked isn't a question of "if" but "how many times?" üò±

> **‚ö†Ô∏è HEADS UP!** This project is just getting started! We're in the very early stages of development, so what you see now is just the beginning. Features mentioned below are what we're working towards, but they might change as we build. Stay tuned!

## üìì Devlog
### Devlog #3 - 404

Added a 404 page ‚Äî easily the most loved page on the whole site (not even kidding).
Also did some housekeeping: updated the README, added a license;)

Small update. Big heart. üíñ

### Devlog #2 - ‚ú®AwUeGsLoYme‚ú® v1 is here!

The first full frontend pass is done... kinda. Trust me ‚Äî there'll probably be like 3 more versions 'cause I'll start hating this one soon üíÄ (not a frontend guy tbh).

Next up: diving into legal stuff! Yes, the no one reads them privacy/terms pages... but still, don't sue me pls üôÉ

### Devlog #1 - Welp, it's something ;P
