## 👀 What's this all about?

DataShadow is your personal digital bodyguard in the wild west of the internet! We handle billions of leaked records scattered across the digital landscape and make it ridiculously easy to check if your data has been compromised.

**Because let's face it:** In today's world, asking if your data has been leaked isn't a question of "if" but "how many times?" 😱

> **⚠️ HEADS UP!** This project is just getting started! We're in the very early stages of development, so what you see now is just the beginning. Features mentioned below are what we're working towards, but they might change as we build. Stay tuned!

## ✨ Features We're Building Soon

- **Breach Checker**: Find out if your email or phone number appears in known data breaches
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified when your info shows up in new leaks
- **Protection Tips**: Personalized advice to secure your digital presence
- **Breach Database**: Access to billions of leaked records (ethically, of course!)
- **User-friendly Interface**: Because security shouldn't require a PhD

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- A sprinkle of magic ✨ and a dash of humor 😄

## 🔮 Future Ideas

- **Privacy Passport**: A digital document showing all places your data exists online
- **Breach Time Machine**: See what data of yours was exposed when
- **Security Score**: Get a personal security rating based on your digital habits
- **Shadow Cleaner**: Help remove your data from places it shouldn't be
